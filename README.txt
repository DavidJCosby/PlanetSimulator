UnitTests are located in src/UnitTests
JavaDocs can be found in the doc folder

If you run the program from Eclipse and the UI doesn't match the screenshot in this folder, please do the following to bring the custom stylesheet in:
 * Through eclipse, go to the src/styles folder
 * double click gruvbox.css and instruct Eclipse to open the file in an external editor
 * doing this should make Eclipse realize this file exists. Try running the program again.


Let me know if you have any questions!
